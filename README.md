Multi-skill Project Scheduling Problem Qt Application

mspsp-qt is a free software to solve the Multi-skill Project Scheduling Problem.

This software was implemented for the research project **"An Adaptive Genetic Algorithm for the Multi-skill Project Scheduling"**.

The abstract is available at [http://metu.academia.edu/semihyagcioglu] (http://www.academia.edu/3740607/An_Adaptive_Genetic_Algorithm_for_the_Multi-skill_Project_Scheduling)

This software contains core classes for the main MSPSP problem and also some GUI classes for enabling users to configure the problem and algorithm parameters. 

The core algorithm is built on the Genetic Algorithms.

mspsp-qt runs on Windows, other operating systems are not supported.
